# General Guidance

## Learning Java

While it may seem obvious, if you wish to create Minecraft: Java Edition plugins, you should invest some time into learning Java \(along with general computer science\). Lots of people jump into it knowing nothing, get frustrated, then quit. Don't be that person; you're better than that.

### Useful Resources

Here are some useful resources when learning Java.

## Choosing an IDE

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. While you could write Java in something like Notepad, **don't**. Just don't. Using an IDE makes you life so much easier, especially if you use a good one. A popular and modern IDE that many serious developers use is [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Download the free "community" edition \(it has everything you need\). An alternative yet still popular choice is [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

## Writing Your First Code

You should get to know your IDE before trying to seriously code anything. I suggest starting with a "[hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)" style project, then experiment a bit and see what you can some up with. Print out messages, test out data types; just have fun with it.

## Building Your Code

So you've written some code and need to test it. You \(hopefully\) selected a build tool like Maven or Gradle. There should be a build button somewhere in your IDE. When you click it, the code will compile. Check the build output for an errors and correct your code if needed. However, your IDE should warn you if there is a problem before you start to build your project.
