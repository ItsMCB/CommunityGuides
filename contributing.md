Our goal is to create and maintain a broad range of Minecraft related guides that anyone willing to learn can read and understand. While we're still developing our process for this, the current idea is to outline each guide in the following way:

* Broad Topic \(ex. Server Administration\)
  * Specific, relevant topic \(ex. Creating a Minecraft: Java Edition Server\)
