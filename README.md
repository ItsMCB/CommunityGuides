# Community Guides

## Project Goal

Welcome to our guide wiki! This is meant to be a useful resource for all Minecrafters who go beyond just playing the game. You can learn more about topics like server administration, plugin development, and much more!

### Topics \(Coming Soon\)

* Server Administration
* [Plugin Development](plugin-development/general-guidance.md)
* Geyser & Floodgate
* Resource Packs

This project is best viewed on our [Gitbook](https://vexelosity.gitbook.io/community-guides/).

## Deliberations

We're currently making some big decisions in regards to the information hosted here. We believe in the open source ideology, and want to contribute to it. The big question is deciding which license would best suit everyone's needs. Feel free to create a pull request with a license along with some comments about why you think it'd fit well for this project. Thank you 💖
